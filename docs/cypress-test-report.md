## Failures: Test Bugs (Fixed)

These were errors in the tests themselves — fixed in this session.

---

### TC3 — QSHS Tier 2 Pricing

**Error:**
```
AssertionError: expected '<td.td-r>' to contain '34.65'
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section1-qshs/tc03-tier2-pricing.cy.js/TC3 — QSHS Tier 2 Pricing -- should apply Tier 2 unit prices to all items (failed).png`

**Root cause:** `pricingTier: 'Tier 2'` was passed inside `fillFenceConfig()` which runs _before_ `generateBom()`. The pricing tier tab control is only interactive after BOM generation — selecting it beforehand has no effect. BOM rendered at Tier 1 prices.

**Fix applied:** Removed `pricingTier` from `fillFenceConfig`. Added `cy.get(SEL.pricingTier).select('Tier 2')` immediately after `generateBom()`.

---

### TC4 — QSHS Tier 3 Pricing

**Error:**
```
AssertionError: expected '<td.td-r>' to contain '32.95'
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section1-qshs/tc04-tier3-pricing.cy.js/TC4 — QSHS Tier 3 Pricing -- should apply Tier 3 unit prices — lowest price point (failed).png`

**Root cause:** Same as TC3 — `pricingTier` set before BOM generation.

**Fix applied:** Same pattern — remove from `fillFenceConfig`, add proxy select call after `generateBom()`.

---

### TC11 — VS Vertical Slat Screen Baseline

**Error:**
```
CypressError: cy.select() failed because it could not find a single <option> with value, index, or text matching: '1200'
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section2-vs/tc11-vs-baseline.cy.js/TC11 — VS Vertical Slat Screen Baseline -- should produce VS-specific product codes (failed).png`

**Root cause (multiple):**
1. `maxPanelWidth: '1200'` — the dropdown only has `2600` and `2000` as options. `1200` does not exist.
2. `assertBomContainsCode('QS-5000-HORIZ')` — this product code does not exist anywhere in the app.
3. `assertBomDoesNotContainCode('QS-5800-SF')` — the app's `generateVerticalRunBOM()` function _does_ emit `QS-5800-SF`, so this assertion would always fail.

**Fix applied:** Changed `maxPanelWidth` to `'2000'`. Removed the specific VS product code assertions entirely (see **App Behavior Gaps — VS System** below for why). Test now only verifies that a BOM is generated successfully. VS-specific code assertions are marked as TODO pending code audit.

### TC12 — VS 90mm Slat in Black Satin

**Error:**
```
CypressError: cy.select() failed because it could not find a single <option> with value, index, or text matching: '1200'
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section2-vs/tc12-vs-90mm.cy.js/TC12 — VS 90mm Slat in Black Satin -- should use 90mm vertical slat code with Black Satin colour codes (failed).png`

**Root cause:** Same `maxPanelWidth: '1200'` issue as TC11.

**Fix applied:** Changed `maxPanelWidth` to `'2000'`.

---

### TC14 — XPL Colour Switch to Black Satin

**Error:**
```
CypressError: cy.select() failed because this element is `disabled`:
<select id="slatSize" data-testid="slat-size" ... disabled="">
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section3-xpl/tc14-xpl-colour-switch.cy.js/TC14 — XPL Colour Switch to Black Satin -- should switch all XPL colour-dependent codes to -B (failed).png`

**Root cause:** When `XPL` is selected, the app disables the entire `slat-size` select and locks it to 65mm. The test passed `slatSize: '65'` to `fillFenceConfig`, which attempted `.select('65')` on the disabled element.

**Fix applied:** Removed `slatSize` from the `fillFenceConfig` call. The app enforces 65mm automatically when XPL is selected — no interaction needed.

---

### TC17 — Single Swing Pedestrian Gate

**Error:**
```
AssertionError: expected '<div#bom-tables>' to contain 'QSG-4200-GSF50'
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section5-gates/tc17-single-swing-gate.cy.js/TC17 — Single Swing Pedestrian Gate (Match Fence) -- should add gate-specific items to BOM separate from fence (failed).png`

**Current note (May 2, 2026):** this historical TC17 finding is now obsolete. The old XP gate-frame family has been retired from active gate BOMs, and QuickScreen gates should use the QSG component stack:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `QSG-4200-GSF50-*` | QuickScreen 50x50 gate side frame |
| `QSG-4800-RAIL65/90-*` | QuickScreen pedestrian gate top/bottom rail |
| `XP-6100-S65-*` / `QS-6100-S90-*` | Standard slats used inside the QSG gate system |
| `QSG-4800-INF-*` / `QSG-4200-CINF-*` | Gate/channel infill |
| `QSG-4200-COVER-*` | Gate screw cover |
| `QSG-GFC-50X50-*` | Gate top caps |

Do not reintroduce `XP-GKIT-*`, `XP-6100-GB65-*`, `XP-6100-HD6545-*`, `XP-SCREWSGF-*`, `XP-LBOX-*`, or `XP-HDL-*` for QSG gates.

---

### TC24 — Very Tall Fence (2400mm)

**Error:**
```
AssertionError: expected 66 to be above 96
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section7-edge-cases/tc24-very-tall-fence.cy.js/TC24 — Very Tall Fence (2400mm) -- should generate BOM without errors for maximum height (failed).png`

**Root cause:** The assertion compared TC24's slat stock count against TC1's count of 96 — but TC24 uses a **10m run** (4 panels) while TC1 uses a **20m run** (8 panels). With half the run length, even a taller fence will produce fewer total stock lengths:

- TC1: 8 panels × 24 slats = 192 pieces ÷ 2 cuts/5800mm = **96 stock lengths**
- TC24: 4 panels × 32 slats (2400mm) = 128 pieces ÷ 2 cuts/5800mm = **~64 stock lengths**

The app returned 66 (close to the expected 64 with waste rounding), which is correct behaviour. The test assertion was logically invalid.

**Fix applied:** Changed `greaterThan(96)` to `greaterThan(48)`. The new threshold (48 = what 4 panels at 1800mm would use) correctly captures "taller fence → more slats per panel" without the run-length cross-contamination.

---

## Failures: App Behavior Gaps (Not Fixed — Requires Investigation)

These failures reflect genuine differences between the test's expectations and the current app's behavior. They are documented here for the React rewrite — the React app should implement the intended behavior.

---

### TC7 — Wall Termination Post Count

**Error:**
```
AssertionError: Timed out retrying after 8000ms: expected '<td.td-r>' to contain '7'
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section1-qshs/tc07-wall-termination.cy.js/TC7 — QSHS Wall Termination Both Ends -- should reduce post count when both ends are wall-terminated (failed).png`

**What's happening:** The test expects that wall termination on both ends reduces post count from 9 to 7 (formula: panels + 1 - 2 wall ends = 8 + 1 - 2 = 7). The second `it` block ("lower grand total") **does pass** — the grand total IS lower when walls are used, suggesting fewer posts are being costed. However, the `XP-2400-FP-SM` quantity still shows 9 instead of 7.

**Likely cause:** The app may be calculating wall terminations and using F-section codes (instead of full posts) for the wall ends, but still adding the F-section posts to the same BOM line as standard posts. Alternatively, the app may use a different post code for wall-terminated ends (e.g., a shorter post or a different SKU) rather than reducing the quantity of `XP-2400-FP-SM`.

**Action for React rewrite:** Audit the existing `generateRunBOM()` logic to confirm how wall terminations affect post count and codes. The test assertion may need updating to match the actual intended behavior (e.g., checking that wall-end posts use a different code, not that `XP-2400-FP-SM` qty drops).

### TC13 — XPL Uses QSHS Side Frame Code

**Error:**
```
AssertionError: expected '<div#bom-tables>' not to contain 'QS-5800-SF'
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section3-xpl/tc13-xpl-baseline.cy.js/TC13 — XPL XPress Plus Premium Baseline -- should use XPL-specific frame codes (failed).png`

**What's happening:** The XPL system is expected to use different frame codes to QSHS. However, the app's `generateRunBOM()` function handles both QSHS and XPL with the same code path, emitting `QS-5800-SF-${colour}` for both.

**This is likely an app bug.** CLAUDE.md explicitly states:
> _XPL (XPress Plus Premium): 65mm slats only (forced). Insert system — slats clip into rails. Different bracket/fixing requirements._

If XPL has different bracket/fixing requirements, it should have different frame/rail codes. The test's assertion (`QS-5800-SF` must NOT appear for XPL) appears intentional and correct in design terms.

**Note:** TC13's second test (`should not allow 90mm slat selection`) **passes** — the select is correctly disabled.

**Action for React rewrite:** Implement XPL-specific frame codes in the `calculate-bom` edge function. Do not share the QSHS code path.

---

### TC15 — BAYG Uses QSHS Side Frame Code

**Error:**
```
AssertionError: expected '<div#bom-tables>' not to contain 'QS-5800-SF'
```

**Screenshot:**  
`cypress/screenshots/section4-bayg/tc15-bayg-baseline.cy.js/TC15 — BAYG Buy As You Go Baseline -- should produce BAYG-specific product codes (failed).png`

**What's happening:** Same situation as TC13 — BAYG also routes through `generateRunBOM()` and produces `QS-5800-SF`. The test expects BAYG to have distinct product codes (and specifically for spacers to appear as separate line items).

**This is likely an app bug.** CLAUDE.md notes:
> _BAYG (Buy As You Go): Spacers are separate line items. Customer assembles themselves._

BAYG is supposed to be a different product structure, not just a relabelled QSHS run.

**Action for React rewrite:** Implement BAYG-specific BOM logic in the edge function. Spacers must appear as individual line items, and BAYG-specific codes must be used.

---

## Uncertain — Needs Investigation

### VS System Product Codes (TC11 / TC12)

The app's `generateVerticalRunBOM()` function exists and produces a BOM for VS-type fences, but it appears to share some codes with the QSHS system (including `QS-5800-SF`). The original test expected:
- `QS-5000-HORIZ` (horizontal rail) — **does not exist in the app**
- `QS-5800-F` (F-section channel) — **existence unconfirmed**
- `QS-5800-SF` to be absent — **incorrect; VS does emit this code**

Until the actual VS product code list is confirmed against the price file, TC11 and TC12 only verify that the VS system generates a BOM without errors. Full product code assertions must be added once the intended VS codes are known.

---

## What to Do Before the React Rewrite

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **High** | Audit wall termination logic — determine correct post codes/counts for wall-terminated ends (TC7) |
| **High** | Confirm XPL-specific frame codes — what replaces `QS-5800-SF` for XPL? (TC13) |
| **High** | Confirm BAYG-specific codes and spacer line items (TC15) |
| **High** | Confirm VS product codes — provide the actual codes for TC11/TC12 assertions |
| **Medium** | Re-run TC3/TC4 after fixes to verify tier switching via proxy select works correctly |
| **Medium** | Re-run TC17 after gate code fix to confirm QSG gate frame/rail/slat/infill/cap hardware appears and old XP gate-frame SKUs do not appear |
