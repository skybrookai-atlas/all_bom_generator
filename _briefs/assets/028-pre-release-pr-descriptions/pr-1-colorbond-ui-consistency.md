## Notes

- This branch was committed by Codex on 2026-05-27. It has been sitting unmerged pending PR opening. No rebase needed if it still applies cleanly to current `main`; if it conflicts, rebase before opening.
- This is the FOUNDATION of the stack — `codex/qsg-sliding-gates-calculator` was started from this branch's tip, so this must merge first.
