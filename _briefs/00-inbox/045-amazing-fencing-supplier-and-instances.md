# Brief 045 — Amazing Fencing: Supplier + System Instances

**Status:** Ready for execution
**Repo:** `github.com/skybrookai-atlas/quickscreen-colorbond-generator`
**Default branch:** `main`
**Depends on:** brief 033 merged (Glass Outlet + the 12 archetypes exist)
**Estimated PR size:** small (one data migration; no schema; no UI; no code)
**Primary reference:** `docs/system-authoring-process.md` Section 7 (admin runbook) + `https://amazingfencing.com.au` (install-side) + `https://www.fencing-supplies.com.au` (supply-side, sister site)

---

## Goal

Add **Amazing Fencing** as the **third supplier** on the platform (after Glass Outlet and Discount Fencing). Create the supplier row + **6 `system_instances`** matching their public product categories. No products / prices / rules in this brief — that's brief 046.

**Updated 2026-05-28:** Added `amazing-retaining-wall` instance after fresh website crawl confirmed retaining walls as a distinct Amazing Fencing product line operating in QLD / NSW / VIC. Liam supplied the Cin7 trade pricing export (`MassDownloadProducts_20260526_0305PM.xlsx`); brief 046 now ships a PUBLISHED tier2 price book with real items.

**Strategic note:** Amazing Fencing is unusual on the platform because they're a **contractor + supplier hybrid**. The install business (`amazingfencing.com.au`) operates across NSW, VIC, QLD, Gold Coast. The supply business (`fencing-supplies.com.au`) is the sister site that publishes the SKU catalogue (no prices publicly). Onboarded as `platform`-tier authored by SkyBrookAI; when they sign the verified-supplier agreement, demote to `verified` via admin UI (brief 035).

**Multi-state implication:** Amazing Fencing operates across 4 metro areas. The visibility layer (brief 044) becomes immediately relevant — NSW Amazing Fencing branch may have different inventory / lead times than QLD branch. For this brief, single-supplier-row with multi-state metadata is sufficient; per-region scoping can be added via brief 046+ or a future brief once Liam confirms operational model.

## Hard rules

- **`localBomCalculator.ts` unchanged.** Test suite UNCHANGED.
- **PR base branch is `main`.**
- **Draft PR only.**

## Files this brief touches

| File | Type of change |

**Explicitly NOT touched:** no code, no UI, no seed JSON yet (brief 046).

## Source material

Public pages on `amazingfencing.com.au` and `fencing-supplies.com.au` as of 2026-05-28:

| Page | Product family | Notes |

**Pricing status:** Amazing Fencing does NOT publish wholesale or retail prices online. Pricing PDF must be obtained directly from them before brief 046 can promote any instance past `readiness_status = 'imported'`. The seed JSON in brief 046 includes SKUs with `default_price: null`.

Amazing Fencing operates across:
- **NSW** — Sydney metro
- **VIC** — Melbourne metro
- **QLD** — Brisbane metro
- **Gold Coast** — separate from Brisbane per their site

## Brand partners (under ColorBond)

- **Gramline** — common steel fence brand
- **Lysaght (BlueScope)** — premium Colorbond brand
- **Oxworks** — Colorbond manufacturer
- **ColorMAX** — Colorbond alternative
- **PermaSteel** — Amazing Fencing's proprietary modular brand

## SKU catalogue captured (no prices)

Brief 046 includes seed JSON for all five instances with the full SKU lists from
fencing-supplies.com.au. Prices are null pending trade pricing PDF.

## TODOs (block readiness promotion beyond 'imported')

- [ ] Obtain trade pricing PDF from Amazing Fencing direct (call 1800 739 359 or email)
- [ ] Confirm whether NSW / VIC / QLD inventories carry different stock — if so, may need per-region price book variants (see brief 046's multi-region note)
- [ ] Confirm relationship between install business and supply business — does the install side mark up the supply pricing?
- [ ] Walk Amazing Fencing through the verified-supplier process; on completion, demote trust_tier from `platform` to `verified` via admin UI
- [ ] Workbook regression for at least 3 configs per instance once pricing arrives
```

## PR description template

```markdown
## Brief 045 — Amazing Fencing: Supplier + System Instances

Adds Amazing Fencing as the third supplier on the platform after Glass Outlet and Discount Fencing. Multi-state install + supply hybrid operating across NSW / VIC / QLD / Gold Coast.

### What's added

- `suppliers` row: `amazing-fencing` (trust_tier `platform`, can be demoted to `verified` after verification)
- 5 `system_instances`: amazing-colorbond, amazing-permasteel, amazing-timber-paling, amazing-timber-slat-screen, amazing-chainwire-security
- `catalogues/amazing-fencing/README.md`

### Verification

- [ ] typecheck / test / build passes; `localBomCalculator.test.ts` UNCHANGED
- [ ] Migration applies cleanly
- [ ] `NOTICE` logs the supplier UUID + 5 instances
- [ ] PR base branch is `main`
```

## Stop points

- If the brief 033 archetype seed didn't run, INSERTs here will fail on the `system_archetypes WHERE slug='...'` subqueries. Surface and fix 033 first.
- The PermaSteel proprietary brand could justify its own archetype (`tubular-fence` or `modular-steel-fence`) in a future architectural iteration. For now, `panel-fence` archetype with metadata covers it.

## After this PR merges

Brief 046 ships the SKU catalogue seed JSON for all 5 instances + a draft price book (status='draft', no items yet) ready for the trade pricing PDF to populate.
