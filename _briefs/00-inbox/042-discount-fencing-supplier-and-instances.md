# Brief 042 — Discount Fencing: Supplier + System Instances

**Status:** Ready for execution
**Repo:** `github.com/skybrookai-atlas/quickscreen-colorbond-generator`
**Default branch:** `main`
**Depends on:** brief 033 merged (Glass Outlet + the 12 archetypes exist)
**Estimated PR size:** small (one data migration; no schema; no UI; no code)
**Primary reference:** `docs/system-authoring-process.md` Section 7 (admin runbook) + `https://www.dfsau.com.au/products` (source-of-truth product range)

---

## Goal

Add Discount Fencing as the **second supplier** on the platform. Create the supplier row + six `system_instances` matching their public product categories. No products / prices / rules in this brief — that's brief 043. This brief is the "we are now multi-supplier in fact, not just in theory" milestone.

**Updated 2026-05-28 after fresh site crawl:**
- `dfsau-aluminium-security` archetype changed from `mesh-fence` → `panel-fence` (structurally more accurate; mesh-fence is chainwire/weldmesh, this is panel-based vertical-bar aluminium)
- Added `dfsau-aluminium-slat-gate` instance for the $399 930×1800 aluminium slat gate promoted on the Colorbond page
- Confirmed `/hampton-pvc`, `/aluminium-custom`, `/rural-and-chainwire` pages are 404 on the live site — those product categories are no longer offered or have moved; removed from the README TODO list

**Strategic note:** Discount Fencing is being added as a `platform`-tier supplier authored by SkyBrookAI (Liam), because Liam holds the source material and is responsible for the data quality. When Discount Fencing later signs the verified-supplier agreement (per brief 040's verification process), the trust_tier can be demoted to `verified` via the admin UI (brief 035) — that's a clean one-row update, no migration needed.

## Hard rules

- **`localBomCalculator.ts` unchanged.** Test suite UNCHANGED.
- **No fork.** This is a deliberate architectural choice — the multi-supplier platform is precisely the path that avoids forking per supplier. Adding Discount Fencing here demonstrates the value of the architecture.
- **PR base branch is `main`.**
- **Draft PR only.**

## PR description template

```markdown
## Brief 042 — Discount Fencing: Supplier + System Instances

Adds the second supplier on the platform: Discount Fencing Supplies (Gold Coast). Creates 5 system_instances spanning their public product range. No products / prices / rules in this brief — see brief 043.

### Why no fork

The multi-supplier architecture (briefs 028-041) is specifically the path that avoids per-supplier forks. Adding Discount Fencing here proves the architecture scales: zero TypeScript changes, zero new tables, one data migration.

### What's added

- `suppliers` row: `discount-fencing` (trust_tier `platform`, can be demoted to `verified` after verification)
- 5 `system_instances`: cca-pine-paling, aluminium-pool, frameless-glass-pool, colorbond, aluminium-security
- `catalogues/discount-fencing/README.md` with source pointers

### Verification

- [ ] typecheck / test / build passes; `localBomCalculator.test.ts` UNCHANGED
- [ ] Migration applies cleanly
- [ ] `NOTICE` message logs the supplier UUID + 5 instances
- [ ] Querying `system_instances` filtered to supplier=discount-fencing returns the 5 rows
- [ ] Calculator picker (when re-opened post-brief-035) lists Discount Fencing as a choice
- [ ] PR base branch is `main`
```

## Stop points

- If brief 033 didn't seed all 12 archetypes (incomplete migration), some of the INSERTs here will fail. Surface and fix 033 first.
- Discount Fencing's actual brand colour from their site logo — current value `#1f3b5c` is an inferred estimate. Replace with the real one if Liam has it.

## After this PR merges

Brief 043 ships the seed data (products + price book v1 + rules wiring) for the two instances where retail pricing is public (timber + aluminium pool). The other three instances (glass, colorbond, security) wait for the pricing PDFs to be downloaded and parsed — those land in follow-up briefs.
