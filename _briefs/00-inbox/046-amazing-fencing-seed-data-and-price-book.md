# Brief 046 — Amazing Fencing: Seed Data + Draft Price Book

**Status:** Ready for execution
**Repo:** `github.com/skybrookai-atlas/quickscreen-colorbond-generator`
**Default branch:** `main`
**Depends on:** brief 045 merged + brief 034 merged (price_books table exists)
**Estimated PR size:** large (5 seed JSON files + 1 data migration for the draft price book)
**Primary reference:** `_briefs/assets/046-amazing-fencing-seeds/` (bundled with this brief) — the seed JSON files that drop into `supabase/seeds/amazing-fencing/products/`

---

## Goal

Seed the **six Amazing Fencing system_instances** (created in brief 045) with their full SKU catalogues. Liam supplied the Cin7 trade pricing export (`MassDownloadProducts_20260526_0305PM.xlsx`, 52 SKUs); this brief ships a **PUBLISHED tier2 (trade) price book** populated from `BuyPriceEx`, covering the timber-paling and retaining-wall instances. The remaining 4 instances (Colorbond, PermaSteel, slat screen, chainwire) still have pricing pending — their SKUs seed with `default_price: null` and stay at `readiness_status = 'imported'`.

This proves the architecture handles **a mixed-pricing supplier** — some instances fully priced from a Cin7 export, some pending separate PDFs from the same supplier.

**Updated 2026-05-28:** Pricing populated for timber + retaining-wall. New 6th instance (retaining wall) added.

## Hard rules

- **`localBomCalculator.ts` unchanged.** Test suite UNCHANGED.
- **All `default_price` fields are `null`** in the seed components. Migration creates a DRAFT price book with zero items.
- **PR base branch is `main`.**
- **Draft PR only.**

## Tests / verification

- `npm run seed:products` succeeds for the new `supabase/seeds/amazing-fencing/products/*.json` folder
- All 5 instances have product + product_component rows after seeding
- All product_components have `default_price = NULL`
- The draft price book has zero `price_book_items` (intentional — populated later)
- `localBomCalculator.test.ts` UNCHANGED

## PR description template

```markdown
## Brief 046 — Amazing Fencing: Seed Data + Draft Price Book

Seeds the 5 Amazing Fencing instances with full SKU catalogues. Prices are null pending trade pricing PDF; draft price book created with zero items, ready to populate.

### What's added

- 5 seed JSON files: colorbond.json, permasteel.json, timber-paling.json, timber-slat-screen.json, chainwire-security.json
- Migration 046: draft `price_books` row + 0 `price_book_items` (intentional)
- Seed loader extended to handle `supabase/seeds/amazing-fencing/` folder

### What's NOT added (pending)

- Pricing — needs Amazing Fencing's trade pricing PDF
- Workbook regression — needs pricing first

### Verification

- [ ] typecheck / test / build passes; `localBomCalculator.test.ts` UNCHANGED
- [ ] `npm run seed:products` ingests `amazing-fencing/` folder cleanly
- [ ] 5 instances have products + components after seed
- [ ] All `default_price` are NULL on amazing-fencing components
- [ ] Draft price book exists with 0 items
- [ ] PR base branch is `main`
```

## Stop points

- If the seed loader doesn't enumerate supplier folders (currently hardcoded to `glass-outlet/`), surface and adjust to walk `supabase/seeds/*/products/*.json`. Same stop-point already identified in brief 043.
- If `pricing_rules.supplier_id` (added in brief 032) hasn't been backfilled by brief 033 by the time 046 runs, surface — the fallback path in `resolve_price_cents` may not scope by supplier correctly.

## After this PR merges

- Amazing Fencing's 5 instances appear in the calculator picker (per brief 035's admin UI / brief 044's visibility rules)
- All instances at `readiness_status = 'imported'`
- A draft price book exists; populating it is the next manual step once Liam obtains the trade pricing PDF
- Workbook regression (brief 038) can run once 3-5 representative job configs from Amazing Fencing's order workflow are available
